# Separate UBGL and Canted sight switch keybinds
Adds the capability to set separate keybinds to the UBGL switch and the Scope/Canted aim mode switch.

Two new options in `Settings -> Control -> Keybinds`

## Installation guide
### Mod installation (This will not be needed later, I just created this so it's easier to delete/disable everything if you want to)

Backup the `.exe` files you wish to replace, so rolling back the change could be achieved by just replacing mine with your backup.

1. Download everything using the `Download ZIP` button

2. Click install with MO2 and press on `Manual`

3. Untick the `Modded Exes` folder

### Custom EXEs installation

1. Open the `.ZIP` that you installed the mod from and navigate to `SERIOUS_UBGL_Separate_keybinds-main\Modded Exes`

2. Open another file explorer and navigate to `Anomaly\bin`

3. Either drop (and replace) all of the `.exe` files or just the version you want to use.

You're done! A good way to test is to check the Settings and see if the keybinds are present. You now can also delete the `Modded Exes` folder from my MO2 mod.

## Troubleshooting

Now these modded exes are directly built on top of my other one that first released with the SSRS weapon mod.
I'm pretty sure you need no additional setup because of this, but if for any reason after following this guide you still run into problems follow this one too:

[SSRS User Manual](https://github.com/Bence7661/stalker-ssrs-user-manual?tab=readme-ov-file#modded-exes) (Skip the first step since you need the newer modded exes provided in the .ZIP file on this page)

## How to revert?

Either use your backed up `.exe` files and replace mine, or download a version from the official [xray-monolith repo](https://github.com/themrdemonized/xray-monolith) and replace mine with those.
