## Installation guide
Now these modded exes are directly built on top of my other one that first released with the SSRS weapon mod.
I'm pretty sure you need no additional setup because of this, but if for any reason after following this guide you still run into problems follow this one too: 
[SSRS User Manual](https://github.com/Bence7661/stalker-ssrs-user-manual?tab=readme-ov-file#modded-exes) (Skip the first step since you need the newer modded exes provided in the .ZIP file on this page)

### Steps

1. Download everything using the `Download ZIP` button
