# Separate UBGL and Canted sight switch keybinds
Adds the capability to set separate keybinds to the UBGL switch and the Scope/Canted aim mode switch.

Two new options in `Settings -> Control -> Keybinds`

## Installation guide
### Mod installation 
This will not be needed later, nor the custom modded exes provided here, when the changes become part of the [themrdemonized / xray-monolith](https://github.com/themrdemonized/xray-monolith) repo.
I will update this page once that happens, but before that I want to add another feature.

Backup the `.exe` files you wish to replace, so rolling back the change could be achieved by just replacing mine with your backup.

1. Download everything using the `Download ZIP` button (If you came from ModDb and downloaded from there it's fine too. It's the exact same thing)

2. Click install with MO2 and press on `Manual`

3. Untick the `Modded Exes` folder

### Custom EXEs installation (built upon [V2025.2.25](https://github.com/themrdemonized/xray-monolith/releases/tag/2025.2.25))

1. Open the `.ZIP` that you installed the mod from and navigate to `SERIOUS_UBGL_Separate_keybinds-main\Modded Exes`

2. Open another file explorer and navigate to `Anomaly\bin`

3. Either drop (and replace) all of the `.exe` files or just the version you want to use.

You're done! A good way to test is to check the Settings and see if the keybinds are present. You now can also delete the `Modded Exes` folder from my MO2 mod.

## How to revert?

Either use your backed up `.exe` files and replace mine, or download a version from the official [xray-monolith repo](https://github.com/themrdemonized/xray-monolith) and replace mine with those.
